;;; event handler macro
;; honestly not sure the best way to do this xD
;; how should the payload parameter fit into this?
;; also, were we supposed to have separate macros for each event?
;; or one macro that just takes the event to register?
;; and why is it saying 'payload is unbound' ? 

;; handle :message events like this:
; bot = bot instance
; :message is the event type
; payload is the parameter name for the payload in the body
; (with-bot-message (bot :message payload) ...)
